The rise of run clubs in Indian metros isn't just about fitness. It's about the fundamental human need for community in an increasingly isolated urban existence.

## The Decathlon Effect

Decathlon democratized sports equipment in India. Suddenly, trying a new sport didn't require a significant financial commitment. Want to try badminton? Here's a Rs 500 racket. Curious about cycling? Entry-level bikes under Rs 10,000.

This lowered barrier created a generation of casual sports enthusiasts. But equipment alone doesn't build habits.

## Community as the Product

Run clubs solved this problem. The product isn't the run – it's the community. Consider what you actually get:

- A scheduled commitment that's harder to skip
- Social accountability
- Post-run conversations and connections
- A sense of belonging to something larger

The running is almost incidental. Many participants could run alone – they have the shoes, they have the routes, they have the fitness. What they don't have is the social structure.

## The Loneliness Economy

We're seeing the emergence of what I call the "loneliness economy" – businesses that sell community wrapped in an activity. Fitness classes, book clubs, co-working spaces, board game cafes – they all follow the same pattern.

The activity is the excuse. The connection is the value.

## What's Next

Expect to see more structured community offerings across categories. The brands that understand they're selling belonging, not just products or services, will win this market.
