Walk into any major Indian retail brand's physical store, then check their website. You'll find different prices, different products, sometimes different promotions entirely.

## The Reality of Indian Retail

Indian omnichannel brands aren't truly omnichannel. They're two separate businesses that happen to share a logo. The online team has different inventory, different margins, and often different leadership than the offline team.

## Why This Happens

Several factors drive this split:

1. **Different cost structures** - Rent for physical retail vs CAC for digital
2. **Different inventory management** - Warehouse vs store fulfillment
3. **Different customer expectations** - Online shoppers are more price-sensitive
4. **Organizational silos** - Digital and retail teams rarely coordinate

## What This Means

For consumers, it means always checking both channels. For brands, it represents a significant operational challenge that few have truly solved.
