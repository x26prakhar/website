An interactive tool that uses demographic data to calculate how many Indians meet specific dating criteria simultaneously.

## The Idea

Ever wondered how many people in India actually meet all those criteria you have for a partner? This calculator does the math for you.

## How It Works

The calculator takes various criteria like:
- Age range
- Education level
- Location (metro vs non-metro)
- Income bracket
- Height

And calculates the intersection of all these demographics to show you the actual pool size.

## Why This Matters

The results are often eye-opening. When you stack multiple criteria, the pool shrinks dramatically. It's a fun way to visualize the trade-offs in dating preferences.
