After years of thinking about it, I finally built my personal website. Here's how I did it.

## The Stack

- **Astro** for static site generation
- **GitHub** for version control and content storage
- **Vercel** for hosting with automatic deployments
- **Decap CMS** for easy content editing

## Why This Approach

I wanted something that:
- Is fast and SEO-friendly
- Lets me write in Markdown
- Doesn't require a database
- Deploys automatically when I push changes
- Has a visual editor for when I don't want to touch code

## The Result

A clean, fast website that I actually enjoy updating. The key was keeping it simple and not over-engineering.
